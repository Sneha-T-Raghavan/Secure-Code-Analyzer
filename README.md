Overview

Secure Code Analyzer is a static application security testing (SAST) tool designed to identify vulnerabilities and coding issues in source code to enhance software security and quality. This tool analyzes codebases for common security flaws such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and more, without executing the code. By integrating with development workflows, it provides actionable insights for developers to remediate vulnerabilities early in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). The tool supports multiple programming languages and leverages advanced static analysis techniques, including taint analysis and pattern detection, to ensure robust security checks.

Features

Vulnerability Detection: Identifies critical security issues like SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, Path Traversal, and LDAP Injection.
Multi-Language Support: Analyzes code in languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript, C#, and C++.
Static Analysis: Performs deep code analysis without execution, catching issues early in the SDLC.
Taint Analysis: Tracks data flow to detect vulnerabilities caused by untrusted inputs.
Comprehensive Reporting: Generates detailed reports for tracking and prioritizing vulnerabilities.

Supported Languages

Python
Java
JavaScript/TypeScript
